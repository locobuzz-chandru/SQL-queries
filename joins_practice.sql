-- advantages of using subqueries:
-- make the queries in a structured form that allows us to isolate each part of a statement.
-- provide alternative ways to query the data from the table otherwise we need to use complex joins and unions.
-- more readable than complex join or union statements.

-- disadvantages
-- they cannot modify a table and select from the same table in the same SQL statement.
-- expensive task, so it's faster to use a join operation.
